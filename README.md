This is Jonas Happ's Processing code for the Simulation of the famous "Game of Live" with a twist.
As a initial position, this code calculates a raster of white and black / dead or alive cells based on any given input image, that could be a logo.

The code then starts the Game Of Life cellular automata.
An example can be seen here:
